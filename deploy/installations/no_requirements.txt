# Instructions for Custom User Dependencies on Sandbox Image
#
#    Open this file, which contains custom user dependencies for your sandbox image.
#
#    Do not confuse these with project dependencies listed in pyproject.txt; those are separate.
#
#    To add a new module, such as the TensorFlow library, follow these steps:
#    a. Type the module name on a new line.
#    b. Specify the required version using the format: module_name==version_number.
#
#    Example:
#        tensorflow==2.3.1
#        spacy==1.1.0
#
# Once you have added all the necessary modules, save the document and rebuild the image using
#        make build_sandbox # Build new image
#        docker image ls    # Validate the new image
#
# Your sandbox image will now incorporate these custom dependencies.
