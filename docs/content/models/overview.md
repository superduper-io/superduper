# Models

A key `Component` type in `Superduper` is `Model` and its descendants.
The intended usage is that `Model` wraps classical AI and machine learning models, 
AI APIs, as well as important processing steps involved in building such models, 
such as feature-computation.

See [here](../apply_api/model) for basic usage. This section gives detailed
usage information as well as information about building your own model types.
