## What is Superduper?

Superduper is a Python based framework for building **end-2-end AI-data workflows and applications** on your own data, integrating with major databases. It supports the latest technologies and techniques, including LLMs, vector-search, RAG, multimodality as well as classical AI and ML paradigms.

Developers may leverage Superduper by building **compositional and declarative objects** which out-source the details of deployment, orchestration and versioning, and more to the Superduper engine. This allows developers to completely avoid implementing MLOps, ETL pipelines, model deployment, data migration and synchronization.

Using Superduper is simply "**CAPE**": **Connect** to your data, **apply** arbitrary AI to that data, **package** and reuse the application on arbitrary data, and **execute** AI-database queries and predictions on the resulting AI outputs and data.

- **Connect**
- **Apply**
- **Package**
- **Execute**

<img src="https://github.com/superduper-io/superduper/blob/main/img/apply.gif" alt="Alt text for the image" style="width: 100%;">

**Connect**

```python
db = superduper('mongodb|postgres|mysql|sqlite|duckdb|snowflake://<your-db-uri>')
```

**Apply**

```python
listener = MyLLM('self_hosted_llm', architecture='llama-3.2', postprocess=my_postprocess).to_listener('documents', key='txt')
db.apply(listener)
```

**Package**

```python
application = Application('my-analysis-app', components=[listener, vector_index])
template = Template('my-analysis', component=app, substitutions={'documents': 'table'})
template.export('my-analysis')
```

**Execute**

```python
query = db['documents'].like({'txt', 'Tell me about Superduper'}, vector_index='my-index').select()
query.execute()
```

Superduper may be run anywhere; you can also [contact us](https://superduper.io/contact) to learn more about the enterprise platform for bringing your Superduper workflows to production at scale. 

## What does Superduper support?

Superduper is flexible enough to support a huge range of AI techniques and paradigms. We have a range of pre-built functionality in the `plugins` and `templates` directories. In particular, Superduper excels when AI and data need to interact in a continuous and tightly integrated fashion. Here are some illustrative examples, which you may try out from our templates:

- Semantic multimodal vector search ([images](https://github.com/superduper-io/superduper/tree/main/templates/multimodal_image_search), [text](https://github.com/superduper-io/superduper/tree/main/templates/text_vector_search), [video](https://github.com/superduper-io/superduper/tree/main/templates/multimodal_video_search))
- [Retrieval augmented generation](https://github.com/superduper-io/superduper/tree/main/templates/retrieval_augmented_generation) with specialized requirements (data fetching involves semantic search as well as business rules and pre-processing)
- [LLM finetuning on database hosted data](https://github.com/superduper-io/superduper/tree/main/templates/llm_finetuning)
- [Transfer learning using multimodal data](https://github.com/superduper-io/superduper/tree/main/templates/transfer_learning)

We're looking to connect with enthusiastic developers to contribute to the repertoire of amazing pre-built templates and workflows available in Superduper open-source. Please join the discussion, by contributing issues and pull requests!

## Core features

- Create a Superduper data-AI connection/ datalayer consisting of your own
  - databackend (database/ datalake/ datawarehouse)
  - metadata store (same or other as databackend)
  - artifact store (to store big objects)
  - compute implementation
- Build complex units of functionality (`Component`) using a declarative programming model, which integrate closely with data in your databackend, using a simple set of primitives and base classes.
- Build larger units of functionality wrapping several interrelated `Component` instances into an AI-data `Application`
- Reuse battle-tested `Component`, `Model` and `Application` instances using `Template`, giving developers an easy point to start with difficult AI implementations
- A transparent, human-readable, web-friendly and highly portable serialization protocol, "Superduper-protocol", to communicate results of experimentation, make `Application` lineage and versioning easy to follow, and create an elegant segway from the AI world to the databasing/ typed-data worlds.
- Execute queries using a combination of outputs of `Model` instances as well as primary databackend data, to enable the latest generation of AI-data applications, including all flavours of vector-search, RAG, and much, much more.

## Key benefits

**Massive flexibility**

Combine any Python based AI model, API from the ecosystem with the most established, battle tested databases and warehouses;  Snowflake, MongoDB, Postgres, MySQL, SQL Server, SQLite, BigQuery, and Clickhouse are all supported.

**Seamless integration avoiding MLOps**

Remove the need to implement MLOps, using the declarative and compositional Superduper components, which specify the end state that the models and data should reach.

**Promote code reusability and portability**

Package components as templates, exposing the key parameters required to reuse and communicate AI applications in your community and organization.

**Cost savings**

Implement vector search and embedding generation without requiring a dedicated vector database. Effortlessly toggle between self hosted models and API hosted models, without major code changes.

**Move to production without any additional effort**

Superduper's REST API, allows installed models to be served without additional development work. For enterprise grade scalability, fail safes, security and logging, applications and workflows created with Superduper, may be deployed in one click on [Superduper enterprise](https://superduper.io/contact).


## What's new in the `main` branch?

We are working on an upcoming release of `0.4.0`. In this release we have:

### Revamped how `Component` triggers initial computations and data dependent computations using `@trigger`

This will enable a large diversity of `Component` types in addition to the well established `Model`, `Listener`, `VectorIndex`.

### Created a general `CDC` (change-data-capture) base class

This will allow developers to create a range of functionality which reacts to incoming data changes

### Developed the concept of `Template` to enable re-usable units of complete functionality

Components saved as `Template` instances, will allow users to easily redeploy their already deployed and tested `Component` and `Application` implementations, on alternative data sources, and with key parameters toggled to cater to operational requirements.

### Added concrete `Template` implementations to the project

These `Template` instances may be applied with Superduper with a simple single command

```
superduper apply <template> '{"variable_1": "value_1",  "variable_2": ...}'
```

or:

```python
from superduper import templates

app = template(variable_1='value_1', variable_2='value_2', ...)

db.apply(app)
```

### Added a user interface and new REST implementation

Now you may view your `Component`, `Application` and `Template` instances in the user-interface, and execute queries using `QueryTemplate` instances, directly against the REST server.

```
superduper start
```

## Getting started

**Installation**:

```bash
pip install superduper-framework
```

**View** available pre-built templates:

```bash
superduper ls
```

**Connect** and **apply** a pre-built template:

(***Note:*** *the pre-built templates are only supported by Python 3.10; you may use all of the other features in Python 3.11+.*)

```bash
# e.g. 'mongodb://localhost:27017/test_db'
SUPERDUPER_DATA_BACKEND=<your-db-uri> superduper apply simple_rag
```

**Execute** a query or prediction on the results:

```python
from superduper import superduper
db = superduper('<your-db-uri>')  # e.g. 'mongodb://localhost:27017/test_db'
db['rag'].predict('Tell me about superduper')
```

**View** and **monitor** everything in the Superduper interface. From the command line:

```bash
superduper start
```

***After doing this you are ready to build your own components, applications and templates!***

**Get started** by copying an existing template, to your own development environment:

```bash
superduper bootstrap <template_name> --destination templates/my-template
```

**Edit** the `build.ipynb` notebook, to build your own functionality.
