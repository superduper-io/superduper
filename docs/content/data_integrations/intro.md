# Data integrations

SuperDuperDB integrates with 3 types of data-backend:

- NoSQL
    - [MongoDB Community Edition](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
    - [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-database)
- SQL
    - [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
    - [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
    - [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/database/)
    - [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/)
    - [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/en/)
    - [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/)
    - [Clickhouse](https://clickhouse.com/)
- In-memory tabular formats
    - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)

Although these data-backends provide very different functionality, 
with SuperDuperDB they are accessible via a uniform API.

However, developers should bear in mind that there are a few 
differences between MongoDB and SQL data-backends.
