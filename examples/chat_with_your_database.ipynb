    "Imagine chatting with your database using just a few lines of code. Sounds unbelievable, right? Well, believe it! We'll show you how you can effortlessly chat with a huge database containing 10 million business records—all with just a few lines of SuperDuperDB code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the behemoth 10M dataset: [FREE COMPANY DATASET](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZSTZRRVYL2/people-data-labs-free-company-dataset)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1YXzAuuQdqkWEQKchglxUuAMzNTKLu5rC#scrollTo=0Zf4Unc_fNBp) for you to quickstart!\n",
    "\n",
    "Chatting with this type of massive dataset using the standard RAG pipeline is next to impossible due to the cost and scale. However, with SuperDuperDB, you can achieve the same functionality with just a few lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can control the low level code while enjoying writing the high level code! So that, you can increase the capacity of it! Whether you're using `Snowflake` or `any other SQL dataset`, we've got your back.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the simplicity of it:\n",
    "1. Connect using your URI (works with any SQL Database).\n",
    "2. Specify your Database/Table Name.\n",
    "3. Craft a query in plain English.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll not only get results but also clear explanations!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let SuperDuperDB and OpenAI do the heavy lifting—all within a single prompt. Stay tuned for more exciting features, including prompt chaining!\n",
    "\n",
    "Bring the power of AI into your database effortlessly! \n",
